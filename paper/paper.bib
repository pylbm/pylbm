    abstract = {We focus on mono-dimensional hyperbolic systems approximated by a particular lattice Boltz- mann scheme. The scheme is described in the framework of the multiple relaxation times method and stability conditions are given. An analysis is done to link the scheme with an explicit finite differences approximation of the relaxation method proposed by Jin and Xin. Several numerical illustrations are given for the transport equation, the Burgers equation, the p-system, and the full compressible Euler system.},
